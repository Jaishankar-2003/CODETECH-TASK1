## Project Overview: Password Strength Assessment Tool

### Project Objective
To develop a robust and user-friendly tool capable of evaluating the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool will analyze various password attributes such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide comprehensive feedback on password security. 

### Key Activities
* **Password Strength Criteria Definition:** Establish clear and measurable criteria for password strength, encompassing factors like length, character types, and complexity.
* **Algorithm Development:** Design and implement algorithms to assess password strength based on the defined criteria.
* **User Interface Design:** Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for inputting passwords and displaying assessment results.
* **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test the tool with a diverse range of password samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
* **Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporate a mechanism to gather user feedback on the tool's effectiveness and usability.

### Expected Outcomes
* A functional password strength assessment tool that accurately evaluates password security.
* Improved user awareness of password security best practices.
* Enhanced password security practices within the target user community.

By successfully completing this project, we aim to contribute to a safer digital environment by empowering users to create stronger, more secure passwords.
